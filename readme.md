# Roll It!

## :memo: What is Roll It!?

Roll It! is a minimalist online dice roller. It was built using the amazing [Pico CSS](https://picocss.com/) library and vanilla JavaScript. It features a random simulation of a dice roll and the posibility to add a second dice.

## :question: Why did you make Roll It!?

Has it happened to you from wanting to play a board game but you couldn't find the dice? Me neither... anyway it was late night, cold ouside, hot coffee in my table, dog snoring by my side...  so why not build a small web app to help me get through a sleepless night?
